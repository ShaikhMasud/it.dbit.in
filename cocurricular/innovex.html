                                    fruitful knowledge. Such information can be used for the betterment and providing

                                    latest urban development plan was released by the BMC in 2015. This data was made
                                    available to the public. The format, however, was not really in a manner that could
                                    be easily understood; or used. It was just raw data. Using GIS, this system aims at
                                    improving the quality of the provided data. The information will be digitalized and
                                    added to the survey maps provided by the BMC. This mapping will be done over in
                                    several steps and will require various software such as QGIS, GeoNode, Cartoview,
                                    ODK, etc. This platform will provide a much better and understandable data format.
                                    In such a system, incorrect data can be checked as the participation of the people
                                    leads to a better insight. The data provided was based on research from a foreign

                                    appropriate calories required by the user for a day . Using this value the
                                    application generates a diet or the user is given an option
                                    to create his own diet from a pre - existing database. Optionally the user can also
                                    feed the information about his eating habits which can be used to generate a more
                                    personalized diet plan . User can also calculate his calories burnt through physical
                                    activity and integrates the results with the diet. User will also be provided with
                                    feedback through a graph which will help user to keep track of his activities
                                    throughout the week.The user is also notified through timely notifications about the
                                    timings of his Meal.</td>

                                    of the hour that measures must be taken to reduce the same. Most measures to reduce
                                    consumption are restricted to being curative. This project deals with developing an
                                    energy monitoring system that will enable consumers to understand how and what they
                                    are being billed for. In addition o this , it will also forecast the consumers
                                    future bill based on their previous and present consumption rates. This will enable
                                    the customers to take measures to reduce their consumption before the end of the
                                    month ,thus saving electricity while lowering the consumers electricty bills. To
                                    summarize, it involves the development of a M2M application that monitors and
                                    reports the electricity usage of the consumers , enabling them to curtail their

                                    two or more java files (i.e. .java). While detecting the plagiarism between the
                                    files it will use the three approaches i.e. Software metrics, Cosine Similarity and
                                    Machine Learning. In Software metrices approach it will check the structure of the
                                    files i.e. number of open and closed braces, function name, percentage of pure
                                    comment lines, average indentation in tabs and white spaces after open braces,
                                    program line length in term of characters, etc. In Cosine Similarity approach it
                                    will check the similarity between the files on the basis of frequency of unique word
                                    count. In Machine Learning approach it will generate rules and patterns on the basis
                                    of clusters formed. Finally it will generate the appropriate result from these
                                    approaches and on the basis of that result it will determined the percentage of
                                    plagiarism between the files.</td>
